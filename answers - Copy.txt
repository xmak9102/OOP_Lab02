Based on Allen Holub's article, accessor methods (getters and setters) should be used sparingly.
They can lead to tight coupling (changes affect many classes) and brittle code (less flexible to class-related changes).
Instead, it's often better to use parameterized constructors (use parameters to initialize) and factory methods (static) to control object creation and initialization.
Accessors should only be used when you need to expose internal state without exposing implementation details.
